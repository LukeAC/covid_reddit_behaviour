The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely and disproportionately impacted people suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems{cite:p}`DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-10518`. Fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation has escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions around the world{cite:p}`Giuntellae2016632118`. Additionally, the social stigma associated with mental health and substance abuse has lead to reluctancy in sharing struggles and seeking help {cite:p}`10.3389/fpsyt.2021.653674`. Many have turned to social media as a medium for people to talk about their experiences and their struggles. Reddit, ranked the 9th most popular social media app in the US, is a platform that provides focused forums (subreddits) where users can subscribe and post anonymously. 

We look into the [Reddit mental health dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.YZl5BC1h1QL) produced by [...]() from which they have selected 15 mental-health-specific subreddit datasets for EDA. These datasets contain collections of Reddit user posts from 2018-2020, and have already beem split into pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. 

We aim to find the impact of COVID-19 on mental health support groups by looking into the data before and after the pandemic. Specifically, we aim to focus the question:  

> Has frequency of explicit description of substance abuse in mental-health-oriented subreddits changed over the pandemic.


## Data set

The datasets were originally obtained from [https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e22635/](https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e22635/). They provide us with two CSV files, for each period (pre and post pandemic), for 15 different subreddits. 

Each observation is a Reddit user's post - a message written on a specific subreddit - which has been processed to extract features that are common in natural language processing [cite TO PAPER]. 

The feature extractions are as follows:
- LIWC (n=62);
- sentiment analysis (n=4); 
- basic word and syllable counts (n=8); 
- punctuation (n=1); 
- readability metrics (n=9); 
- term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) ngrams (256-1024) to capture words and phrases that characterize specific posts; 
- manually built lexicons about suicidality (n=1), economic stress (n=1), isolation (n=1), substance use (n=1), domestic stress (n=1), and guns (n=1). 

Alongside these features include:
- Reddit user name
- Date of post
-
